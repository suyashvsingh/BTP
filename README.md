# NOMA Simulation for downlink model

This is a Python script that simulates the downlink model for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with Cognitive Radio (CR) using Monte Carlo simulation. It calculates the probability of detection (P<sub>d</sub>) for different values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and plots the graph between them.

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- joblib
